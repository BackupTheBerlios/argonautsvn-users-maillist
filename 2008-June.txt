Subject: [ArgonautSVN-users] Error Installing r18
Message-ID: <36fc01f10806112136m2868f337q8a2e748c86ffc1ca@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Great project! I hope it is still being
actively developed and maintained.

I tried to install the latest trunk r18
and got the following error:

running install_data
creating /usr/share/argonautsvn
creating /usr/share/argonautsvn/glade
copying share/glade/commitdialog.glade -> /usr/share/argonautsvn/glade
copying share/glade/credentialsdialog.glade -> /usr/share/argonautsvn/glade
creating /usr/lib/nautilus/extensions-1.0
creating /usr/lib/nautilus/extensions-1.0/python
copying nautilus/asvn-contextmenu.py -> /usr/lib/nautilus/extensions-1.0/python
error: can't copy 'nautilus/asvn-emblems.py': doesn't exist or not a
regular file

cheers
James
