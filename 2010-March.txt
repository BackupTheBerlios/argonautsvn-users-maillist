Subject: [ArgonautSVN-users] Project status?
Message-ID: <20100308120822.353fad27@ws80.int.tlc>

Hello,

I just stumbled upon ArgonautSVN today.  I've been hoping something
like this would come along, and I was even considering writing it
myself.  I used to use TortoiseSVN in Windows, but I've been
Windows-free (at least for development) for over 5 years now...
TortoiseSVN is the only thing I miss. :-)

However, it looks like this project hasn't seen any activity for about
3 years.  Is there anything to report?  Or any other project that will
fill this same void?  I've considered writing something myself, so if I
ever get over my procrastination, I may try to pick up this project.

TTYL!
